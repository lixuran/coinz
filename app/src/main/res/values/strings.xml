        "Welcome, Companion, to the city of Whiterun! This City has heard of your bravery on the battel field, and the yarl himself has been deeply improessed.\n
        As his stward, it would be my pleasure to bring his lordship's offer to you.As you might have seen on the way here, the country of whiterun is currently possessed by ancient dragons from the second era.\n
        Many has died under their claws.The people need a savior, now  more than ever. Therefore the yarl has ordered you, as well as other advantures, to fight against those monsters, beat them and bring back peace and hope to the land of Skyrim.\n      The location of their nest has been marked on your map, be sure to note it down before you set off. As you slay those dragons, you would get different kinds of dragon scales,
        a valuable resource that can be sold for gold, or even better,used to purchase properties from me! Since this is war time, our fianase is relatively short,the yarl is only willing to pay for 25 pieces of scales per day,,but you can always send your spare scales to your fellow companions so that they may put it to better use! \n
        Here is a copy of the yarl's contract in case you would like to find out more about it. Good luck and may we meet in Sovngarde again!"
